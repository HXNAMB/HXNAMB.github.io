## The Basics

What are these curated laws you may wonder. Which is totally valid and we don't deny that query. So here we are to learn about these laws. From reading the [purpose](Purpose) you must've gained knowledge that **hxnamb** is something the world needs and without that nothing can survive. 

So, when we live in such a universe where hxnamb is key to our existence -- we need a set of laws which define the nature of the universe and how everything works in reality. You will now be learning few laws and theories carefully curated by three people namely:

1. Hxnamb [ Highness herself ]   
2. AdiSai
3. AV

## Documentation

Each law has been carefully curated by us three contributors and define the **Hxnamb Universe**. We have made it easy enough for everyone to understand how everything works in reality and how each law works. The inter - relations and depencies have also been mentioned properly. 

 We hope that you have a wonderful time reading through the documentation as we did spend much of our time ensuring that the user experience in which one dives into this beautiful universe in the digital form is a hassle free experience. 

## Gratitude

Hxnamb and the contributors are very much thankful for you who is taking your own time to read through this amazing documentation of each law present in the "Hxnamb Universe" :thumbsup:
