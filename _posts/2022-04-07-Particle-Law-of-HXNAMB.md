## Statement

Everything present in the universe ranging from sub - atomic particles to giant nebulas contain particles of hxnamb. From the purpose we get to know that everything has to be hxnamb. Thus everything and everyone regardless of living nature are HXNAMB.

## Uses

Where will the particle law of hxnamb be used? This is a very good question that arises. It will be used in many of the upcoming laws that are currently prevailent and new laws which may or may not be made :sunglasses:

## Proof

We derive this simple theoratical statement which is true from the philosophy and the truth about the nature of HXNAMB and her purpose.
