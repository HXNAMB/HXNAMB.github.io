## The Particle Law 

### Statement

Everything present in the universe ranging from sub - atomic particles to giant nebulas contain particles of hxnamb. From the purpose we get to know that everything has to be hxnamb. Thus everything and everyone regardless of living nature is / are HXNAMB.

### Explanation

Universe of Hxnamb may hereby be referred to as **UOH** 
{:.info} 

What is this law trying to state? It's pretty simple. As we know each item [ regardless living or non -- living ] is made up of smaller particles and thus they are made up of atoms. These are further made up of sub -- atomic particles named as protons, neutrons and electrons. What this law is stating is that, **every single** atom in the **Universe of Hxnamb** consists of small amounts of hxnamb. 

When we see each sub -- atomic particle, these hxnambs constitute around 10%. It may not seem alot. Yet when viewed in the continuum -- this results in a large amount. By thorough research conducted both theoratically and experimentally it has been proved that on an average, hxnamb constitutes to nearly 35 - 50 % in that molecule. 

This is present throughout to each and every particle type out there. This also includes both living and non -- living organisms, synthetically produced molucules, etc.

### Uses

Where will the particle law of hxnamb be used? This is a very good question that arises. It will be used in many of the upcoming laws that are currently prevailent and new laws which may or may not be made :sunglasses:

Hxnamb and the contributors consider this as the **Parent Rule** for all the other laws present / will be present out there. Hence, you will be using this very often.
